        I am a dedicated Software Engineer specializing in low-level native app
        and graphics development. I enjoy crafting high-performance,
        close-to-hardware solutions using technologies like libwayland,
        libpulseaudio, wgpu, and Vulkan. Additionally, I have strong expertise
        in web development with modern tools like Next.js, React, and Tailwind
        CSS. I also take pleasure in hosting apps on my own hardware, pushing
        the boundaries of both performance and functionality.
