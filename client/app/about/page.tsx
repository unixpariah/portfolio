        I am a passionate Software Engineer with a focus on building performant,
        low-level native applications and graphics systems. My expertise spans
        across technologies like libwayland, libpulseaudio, Vulkan, and wgpu,
        where I craft solutions that interact closely with the hardware for
        maximum efficiency. My journey in software engineering began with a
        fascination for working at the system level, which evolved into a deep
        interest in creating high-performance, user-facing applications. In
        addition to my technical work, I have a deep interest in combat sports,
        particularly Muay Thai and boxing. I've actively participated in
        tournaments, where my competitive spirit and discipline have driven me
        to push my limits both physically and mentally. The dedication, focus,
        and resilience required in the ring mirror the qualities I bring to my
        professional work, where I tackle challenges head-on and strive for
        excellence in every project. Beyond the tech world, I also have
        extensive experience in web development, leveraging modern frameworks
        like Next.js and React, along with design systems such as Tailwind CSS.
        This versatility allows me to tackle a wide range of projects, from
        native applications to responsive web solutions. I'm always eager to
        learn and explore new technologies, currently diving deeper into
        full-stack development and expanding my toolkit for building
        cross-platform solutions. I thrive in environments that value
        collaboration and problem-solving, and I'm driven to contribute to
        projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in software
        engineering. This version integrates your passion for Muay Thai and
        boxing, highlighting how your experiences in sports shape your approach
        to work. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
