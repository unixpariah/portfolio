        More than just a title—let&rsquo;s dive deeper!
      </h2>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground max-w-[120ch]">
        I am a passionate Software Engineer focused on building performant,
        low‑level native applications and graphics systems. My expertise spans
        technologies like libwayland, libpulseaudio, Vulkan, and wgpu—crafting
        solutions that interact closely with hardware for maximum efficiency.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground max-w-[120ch]">
        My journey began with a fascination for system‑level development, which
        evolved into a strong interest in creating high‑performance, user‑facing
        applications.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground max-w-[120ch]">
        Outside of tech, I have a deep interest in combat sports, particularly
        Muay Thai and boxing. I&rsquo;ve participated in tournaments, where my
        discipline and competitive spirit push me to grow physically and
        mentally. These qualities translate directly to my work—resilience,
        focus, and a drive to overcome challenges.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground max-w-[120ch]">
        I also bring experience in web development, using modern frameworks like
        Next.js and React, along with Tailwind CSS. This versatility lets me
        handle projects ranging from native apps to responsive web solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground max-w-[120ch]">
        I&rsquo;m always learning, currently diving deeper into full‑stack
        development and cross‑platform tools. I thrive in collaborative
        environments and aim to contribute to projects that challenge and
        innovate in software engineering.
